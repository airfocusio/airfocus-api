# Help

If you have any questions about the airfocus API or this documentation - you can start a new [Discussion](https://github.com/airfocusio/dev-docs/discussions/categories/general).

If you have found a bug in the API or the schema, or this documentation - please create a new [Issue](https://github.com/airfocusio/dev-docs/issues), but please check if there is already an issue for that bug before creating a new one.

If you have general questions or need help with the airfocus product itself - please visit our [Help Center](https://help.airfocus.com)
or ask our customer support team [support@airfocus.com](mailto:support@airfocus.com) for help.

{: .note }
If you need to make a reference to the API schema in your Issues or Discussions - we have a [VCS snapshot of the schema](https://github.com/airfocusio/dev-docs/blob/main/openapi.json) for that purpose.
Note: the linked schema is just a copy of the actual schema served by the server,
and it can be slightly outdated, as there is usually some delay between deploying a server with new schema and then updating the JSON file in the repository.
